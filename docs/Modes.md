# Modes, Themes, and Keyboard Handlers

All modes, themes, and keyboard handlers should be required through ```brace``` directly.  Browserify will grab these modes / themes / keyboard handlers through ```brace``` and will be available at run time.  See the example above.  This prevents bloating the compiled javascript with extra modes and themes for your application.

### Example Modes

* javascript
* java
* python
* xml
* ruby
* sass
